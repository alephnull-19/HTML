    <h1>Great Depression</h1>
    <hr />

    <p>The
      <b><i>
	  <dfn>Great Depression</dfn>
      </i></b>
      was a severe worldwide economic depression between 1929 and 1939 that began after a major fall in stock prices in the United States. The economic contagion began around September 4<sup>th</sup>, 1929, and became known worldwide on <b>Black Tuesday,</b> the stock market crash of October 29<sup>th</sup>, 1929.</p>

    <p>Between 1929 and 1932, worldwide <abbr title="gross domestic product" >(GDP)</abbr> fell by an estimated 15%. By comparison, worldwide GDP fell by less than 1% from 2008 to 2009 during the Great Recession. Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s. However, in many countries, the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the beginning of World War II.</p>

    <h3>Productivity shock</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <p>It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the [productivity, output, and employment] trends we are describing are long-time trends and were thoroughly evident before 1929. These trends are in nowise the result of the present depression, nor are they the result of the World War. On the contrary, the present depression is a collapse resulting from these long-term trends. <br /><br /> <b>-â€‰M. King Hubbert</b> </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The first three decades of the 20th century saw economic output surge with electrification, mass production, and motorized farm machinery, and because of the rapid growth in productivity there was a lot of excess production capacity and the work week was being reduced.</p>
